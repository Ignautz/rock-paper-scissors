    New requirements for front end RPS game: 
    Go back to your “Rock Paper Scissors” game from a previous lesson and give it a 
    simple UI so that the player can play the game by clicking on buttons rather 
    than typing their answer in a prompt.

        X. Copy your original code into a new file so you don’t lose it.
        X. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
        X. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to 
           the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection 
           every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
        X. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM 
           methods.
        X. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player 
           reaches 5 points.
        X. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make 
           it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the 
           programmer’s life.
        X. Don’t forget to go back and add your new version to the original 
           Rock Paper Scissors Project!
    
    
    Original requirements for the JS functionality to play RPS in console. 
    Requirements: 
    1. Start a new Git repo for your project.
    
    2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. 
    This game is going to be played completely from 
    the console, so don’t worry about putting anything 
    else in there.
    
    3. Your game is going to play against the computer, 
    so begin with a function called computerPlay that 
    will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or 
    ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to 
    make the computer’s play.

    4. Write a function that plays a single round of 
    Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two 
    parameters - the playerSelection and 
    computerSelection - and then return a string 
    that declares the winner of the round like so: 
    "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
        1. Make your function case insensitive 
        (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any 
        other variation)
        2. Important note: you want to return the 
        results of this function call, not console.log()
        them. To test this function console.log the 
        results.
    5. Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous 
    function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that 
    keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

        1. You have not officially learned how to “loop” over 
        code to repeat function calls… if you already know 
        about loops from somewhere else (or if you feel like 
        doing some more learning) feel free to use them. If not, 
        don’t worry! Just call your playRound function 5 
        times in a row. Loops are covered in the next lesson.
        
        2. At this point you should be using console.log() 
        to display the results of each round and the winner 
        at the end.
        
        3. Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the 
        docs here if you need to.
        
        4. Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you 
        need to. Specifically, you might want to change the 
        return value to something more useful.
        
        5. Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you 
        think it would be useful.
